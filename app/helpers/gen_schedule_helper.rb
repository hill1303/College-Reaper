  # This ScheduleGenerator class provides some general methods for generating sets of schedules based on user preferences
  # and a set of class sections that are available from which to make schedules.
  #
  # NOTES: Behind the scenes, a genetic algorithm is employed which attempts to approach the NP-Complete problem of creating
  # all possible schedule permutations from a set of class sections and provides an approximation of an optimal schedule based
  # on preferences. Because of this, some of the methods available to the schedule generators consider schedules in a  genetic
  # paradigm rather than strictly as schedules/classes. Notably, the documentation will have the following vocabulary.
  #   * Individual: a single entity that exists as part of a population. As it pertains to this class, an individual is a
  #     schedule.
  #   * Mutation: altering a genetic sequence to contain new, possibly unseen genes. As it pertains to this class, a
  #     schedule's class section set gets altered to possibly contain new, random class sections.
  #   * Mate Selection: individuals select mates that are close in fitness to themselves, but have a low probability of
  #     selecting a random mate from a gene pool. As it pertains to this class, a mate is a schedule whose aggregate score
  #     is most similar to another schedule's aggregate score, or a random selection from a schedule set.
  #   * Fitness: the overall rank/ability of an individual to survive in a population. As it pertains to this class, a
  #     schedule's fitness is it's aggregate heuristic score.
  #   * Population: a large group of individuals that interact by "mating" (ie. exchanging genes) and dying. As it pertains
  #     to this class, a population is a set of schedules.
  #   * Genes: a single item used in a sequence/set to represent an individual's unique properties. As it pertains to this
  #     class, a schedule's class sections are considered individual genes.
  #   * Gene Sequence: a set of genes that make up the representation of an indivual. As it pertains to this class, a
  #     schedule's class section set is considered a gene sequence.
